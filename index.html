              <p>If you’re already a smartphone owner</p>
              <p>
                You probably have some pretty strong feelings about the platform of your next phone.
                But if you’re open to change, assess your options. iOS is considered the easiest to learn and use, 
                and is where the latest and greatest apps usually make their debut. Android is highly customizable and offers tight 
                integration with Google’s service, and Android smartphones generally see the latest advances in hardware first. Windows 
                Phone is a less popular option that’s more like iOS and Android, but its major fault is the substantial gap between its 
                app offerings and those of the more popular platforms.

              <p>Dash Charge vs SuperCharge vs Quick Charge vs Turbo Charge: Fast Charging Battle!</p>
              <p>
                With the phones completely discharged, I connected them to their chargers. Then, it was a matter of waiting. 
                To my surprise, the View 10 with Huawei’s Super Charge tech reached a 100% in 1 hour and 21 minutes. Seriously amazing,
                 considering its bigger 3,750 mAh battery. If you’re wondering about the OnePlus 5T, and I know you are, don’t worry, 
                 Dash Charge wasn’t too far behind, with the OnePlus 5T taking just 2 extra minutes, 
                 getting fully charged in 1 hour and 23 minutes.

              <p>Gaming on a smartphone is more popular than ever</p>
              <p>
                While the latest Apple and Samsung phones are capable of running the most demanding mobile games, the market is so popular that 
                there are also dedicated gaming phones like the Asus ROG Phone 5, Red Magic 7 and Black Shark 4 Pro.
                Since there are only a handful like this, we've also included the odd 'normal' 
                phones that also offer a good gaming experience.

              <p>Determine how you’re going to buy</p>
              <p>
                Even if you’ve already chosen your carrier and your smartphone, you likely still have 
                some choices to make when it comes to actually buying your phone. The most familiar way for 
                the majority of shoppers is to buy a phone on-contract; by signing a two-year contract,
                you can get a high-end phone at a deeply discounted upfront price 
                and pay off the cost of it over the length of your contract.

                These phones often have specialised hardware or even sometimes clip-on controllers to help you game better.
                Internals often have boosts in RAM or the most powerful CPU or GPU to help the phone keep up,
                while high refresh rate displays are common to allow you to hit even higher frame rates 
                while playing. A couple even have liquid cooling.
